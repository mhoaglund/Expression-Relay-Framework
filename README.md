# Expression-Relay-Framework

Next-Gen Artist Statement composition framework designed to produce artist statements that better keep step with generative art practices, lateralism, social media data representation, and collecting/list-making composition strategies. This framework includes an opinionated desire to qualify and interconnect descriptors of practice so that a discrete system of meaning can be constructed instead of a narrative. This framework is likely to be an unnecessary hindrance for workers who mainly use a narrative form. This framework's spirit of description takes after three generational forms- the concrete poem, the resume, and the wiki. The overall design intent here is to incorporate the balance of freedom and structure found within a concrete poem, the iterative FIFO structure of the resume over time, and the interconnectedness and variable voice of the wiki.

This framework defines a spec for constructing a Trello board to act as an artist statement.
