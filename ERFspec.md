## Expression Relay Framework

Next-Gen Artist Statement composition framework designed to produce artist statements that better keep step with generative art practices, lateralism, social media data representation, and collecting/list-making composition strategies. This framework includes an opinionated desire to qualify and interconnect descriptors of practice so that a discrete system of meaning can be constructed instead of a narrative. This framework is likely to be an unnecessary hindrance for workers who mainly use a narrative form. This framework's spirit of description takes after three generational forms- the concrete poem, the resume, and the wiki. The overall design intent here is to incorporate the balance of freedom and structure found within a concrete poem, the iterative FIFO structure of the resume over time, and the interconnectedness and variable voice of the wiki. (fix this run-on)

Functionally, the ERF spec specifies a method for creating a Trello board which will contain the content for an artist statement. Once this Trello board is constructed in a way that satisfies the spec, the board itself can be used as an artist statement or a distributable pdf document can be generated for free at mhoaglund.erfgen.com.

To begin, create a Trello board and add Lists with the following names. It's important to match these exactly if you'd like to generate a pdf later using ERFgen.

* Color Code\*
* Evaluative Impulses
* Questions
* Tags
* Connected Concepts
* Point of View
* Statements
* Further Reading\*

  *: Optional list

# Color Code
This optional list is an opportunity for you to insert an arbitrary color-coding structure into your artist statement which can be used to create an extra layer of information. As an example, if within other lists I know I will be including items which may have more or less priority or power in describing my practice, I might create a color code to represent that. Red for high priority, Blue for marginal priority, etc. To add a coded color, add a card with a label color and a brief (100 words or fewer) written indication of the meaning of that color.

# Evaluative Impulses
Add a card to this list for every impulse which guides your determination of whether your artist statement adequately represents your position and practice. For example if I emphasize *Clarity* or *Specificity* as properties of my practice that also extend to how I communicate about it, these properties are worth listing. If desired, a card suggesting a way of reading can be added here: for example "skim Tags, read Connected Concepts last".

#Questions
List the questions you intend to answer about your practice using this artist statement. This is meant to do two things: to list the questions that guide your investment in your communication about your work (thereby serving as a side channel in describing the work), and to set expectations with folks who consume the statement.

#Tags
List any terms, movements, artists, names of discrete concepts, disciplines, crafts, histories that are included in your work or related to it in your reckoning. The intent behind this collection is modelled after other contemporary tag collections and is meant to invoke the same spirit of description. Tag cards have a 100-character limit.

#Connected Concepts
This list is a bit like the previous one, but goes into greater detail. Choose a few concepts which are best related in a more in-depth way. Describe them to the extent that is necessary, but remember that the intent of this list is to serve as a simple collection of ideas that are external to your work but intimately related to it. This list offers the power to place your work with great resolution, but is not meant to contain a description of your work.

#Point of View
Add a card to this list for every irreducible property that you can observe about your own point of view. This could result in a list of beliefs or biases, or could even end up listing mistakes you always seem to make. This list is about self-representation, hopefully on the road to capturing your world view.

#Statements
From Statement to Statements. This list is meant to be site for synthesizing whole, concise thoughts out of the cards laid out in all previous lists. Create a card for every meaningful sentence you can construct to honestly represent a part of your practice. Where other lists can't legitimately allow you to contradict yourself, this one can.

#Further Reading
This optional list can contain a list of auxiliary resources, possible referenced in other cards. Each card must contain a hyperlink that leads to the resource and the name of the resource.
